git add filename.extension : this command adds the specified file to the staging area, should immediately be followed by a git commit.

git commit -m "commit message" : this command commits the file specified in git add to the index. Commits should be made whenever you make a change *that works*
	this includes even small changes (such as adding a function). Put meaningful messages.

git rm filename.extension : this command is used to remove files from the repository. We will most often be creating and updating existing files, but this
	command may come up.

	on github.
